# Real-Time-face-recognition-under-partial-occlusion
This project will recognize the face from a live video and display the name of the person if it matches otherwise, it will display as "not recognized".
The project encompasses both training and testing phases, ensuring the VGG16 modelâ€™s efficacy in real-time face recognition under partial occlusion
## Model used in project
In this project, VGG16 and Googlenet model are used and compared for the accuracy. 
We got better accuracy with VGG16 model, hence we deployed this model in our project.
## Uniqueness of project
The project will recognize the face under partial occlusion also means if a person wearing some kind of disguised makeup or covered his face using some kind of accessories.
At this point also, the model will recognize the face and display the name of the person if it matches.
